# first_project

Welcome to my first coding project which is a personal website.

## Reasoning

I chose to go with a personal website as HTML/CSS were the first languages that I learned. And overall it just seems like a solid starting point to build something tangiable as soon as possible to keep me interested in this whole coding thing.

## Goals

The main goal of this website is to see my progression as I come up with new interesting features/stylings to add to it. The website is not as much about the content as about the individual features being implemented. The main goal at the moment is to finish the basic HTML/CSS and build a decently looking parallax background which would be a little different for each individual page on the site.

## Used languages

Languages and frameworks being used/considered (hopefully this list gets longer over time):

    1. HTML
    2. CSS
    3. JavaScript

## Fellow coders input

If you happen to come across my website or my repo please feel free to let me know about possible additions to the website that you think might look good/interesting on it. As I stated before, please disregard the content itself as you most likely won't find it interesting anyway and please focus on the overall apearance and functionality.
